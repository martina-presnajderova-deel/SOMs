    "**Why?** Credit to GDP gap is defined in Basel: Under the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (aka Basel III), the countercyclical capital buffer system of the banking system should be raised when a nation's credit-to-GDP ratio (where credit is defined as credit given to the household and private non-financial corporate sector or HH and PNFC credit) exceeds its long-term trend by two percentage points\n",

    "- Firstly, it requires banks to build up a buffer of capital in good times which may be used to maintain flow of credit to the real sector in difficult times.\n",

Long-term interest rates are generally averages of daily rates, measured as a percentage. These interest rates are implied by the prices at which the government bonds are traded on financial markets, not the interest rates at which the loans were issued. In all cases, they refer to bonds whose capital repayment is guaranteed by governments. Long-term interest rates are one of the determinants of business investment. Low long-term interest rates encourage investment in new equipment and high interest rates discourage it. Investment is, in turn, a major source of economic growth.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### DATA SOURCE - Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Central Data Repository (CDR) Public Data Distribution (PDD) website and its data\n",
    "FFIEC collects and provides through CDC publicly available **Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports)** and **Uniform Bank Performance Reports (UBPRs)** for most FDIC-insured institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every national bank, state member bank, and insured nonmember bank is required by its primary federal regulator to file a Call Report as of the close of business on the last day of each calendar quarter (the report date). \n",
    "* The specific reporting requirements depend upon the size of the bank and whether it has any foreign offices. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Uniform Bank Performance Report\n",
    "**What is the Uniform Bank Performance Report?**  The UBPR is a multi-page financial analysis of a commercial bank or savings bank that files the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Report). \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the source of UBPR data?**  Virtually all of the dollar values, ratios, peer group averages and percentile rankings within the UBPR are computed from financial data reported by commercial banks and savings banks on the quarterly Call Report. A minor amount of structural or non-financial data comes from the banking agencies, including the number of branches and MSA codes used in UBPR ratios and peer group analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What kinds of data appear in the UBPR?**  There are five principal types of financial data contained in the UBPR.\n",
    "* 1.Dollar data for individual banks appears on most pages and is **derived from the Call Report and the Summary of Deposits**. All dollar data is displayed in thousands, consistent with the standard used in the Call Report. Income and expense data that appears in the UBPR is generally year-to-date. Balance sheet data displayed in the UBPR is usually a spot or end-of-period value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2.Ratio data appears on many pages. Some ratios are quite complex and involve several levels of computation. Ratios are displayed in percent format to two decimals of precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3.Peer group average data is computed for many ratios. An average of a given ratio for all banks within the peer group is presented as a benchmark to measure individual bank performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 4.Percentile rankings are computed for most ratios contained in the UBPR. It is a value from 0 to 99 and reflects the percentile or percentage position of a given bank relative to other peer banks for a specific ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5.Some structural or demographic information is displayed, including identifying information such as RSSDID number, Certificate Number, street address and holding company information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Which banks is the UBPR computed for?**  The UBPR is computed for all commercial banks and savings banks that file a Call Report. Due to data incompatibility, the UBPR was previously not computed for savings banks supervised by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). However, with the implementation of the Dodd Frank Act and sunset of the OTS on July 21, 2011, all thrifts are required to submit Call Reports instead of Thrift Financial Reports effective March 2012, and UBPRs are available for these institutions beginning at that time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Link to Call Data** How is the availability of UBPR data impacted by processing of the underlying Call Report?  Most data found in the UBPR is derived directly from the Call Report filed by banks. As a consequence, the availability of UBPR data is linked directly to the availability of Call Report data. Call Report data is filed by banks as of quarter end. After the Call Report is processed and validated, UBPR data will be computed within 24 hours. For many banks the UBPR will be available within 48 hours of a successful Call Report submission. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How Many Reports that Use UBPR Data are Available?**\n",

    "\n",
    "Additional information\n",
    "\n",
    "* The UBPR is organized by subject, e.g., earnings, balance sheet, asset quality, liquidity, and capital. \n",
    "* Each report contains data for five separate periods of time (quarters) that tie to the quarterly Call Report filed by banks. \n",
    "* The UBPR compares the performance of a given bank both against itself over time and against the performance of a group of peer banks. Peer group average and percentile ranking data provide benchmarks to measure bank performance. \n",
    "* A UBPR may be viewed online, printed, or exported to a delimited file for further use in Excel. Additionally, once implemented within the Central Data Repository, the UBPR may be exported to an eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) file for use in XBRL enabled tools.\n",
    "* The principal target audience for the UBPR is federal and state banking supervisors and the banks they supervise."

    "From the risk management perspective, bank capital provides the institution with a \"cushion\" to absorb losses, it allows institutions to continue operating during adverse financial periods, thus helping to maintain confidence in the banking system and minimize liquidity concerns. Moreover capital helps restrict excessive asset growth - the minimum capital ratio requirements limit unjustified asset expansion by requiring that asset growth is funded by a commensurate amount of additional capital. \n",

    "* **Common equity tier 1 capital (CET1)** - Tier 1 is the most loss-absorbing form of capital, it consist of shareholders' equity and retained earnings and is easily available and used to absorb losses without any effect on the business operations.  This componnet is intended to measure bank's financial health and as a result of financial crisis, Tier 1 Capital is one of the main focus of The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In the past banks would have a lot of non-equity (such as hybrid debt) in their capital structures and this has proven to be insufficient and lead to developing a need for certain level of high quality capital, where higher quality capital means more loss-absorbing capacity. This greater focus on common equity, the highest quality component of a bank’s capital means that banks will be stronger, allowing them to better withstand periods of stress.\n",
    " * Under Basel III, the minimum tier 1 capital ratio is 10.5%, which is calculated by dividing the bank's tier 1 capital by its total risk-based assets.\n",
    " * It includes qualifying common stock and related surplus net of treasury stock; retained earnings; certain accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) elements if the institution does not make an AOCI opt-out election, plus or minus regulatory deductions or adjustments as appropriate; and qualifying common equity tier 1 minority interests. - Ref: https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section2-1.pdf\n",
    " \n",
    "* **Additional tier 1 capital (AT1)** - Although the main component of Tier 1 capital must be CET1 capital, Basel III allows instruments to be included in a second element of Tier 1 capital called Additional Tier 1 (AT1), if they meet certain requirements. As CET1 capital is considered the highest quality and the most effective in absorbing losses, AT1 capital is a supplementary form of Tier 1 capital, it consists of instruments that are continuous, in that there is no fixed maturity (such as preferred shares), but that *can* - and in the case of trigger event *will* - be converted into equity. Trigger event being when CET1 capital falls below a threshold.\n",
    " * It includes qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, bank-issued Small Business Lending Fund and Troubled Asset Relief Program instruments that previously qualified for tier 1 capital, and qualifying tier 1 minority interests, less certain investments in other unconsolidated financial institutions’ instruments that would otherwise qualify as additional tier 1 capital. - Ref: https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/safety/manual/section2-1.pdf\n",

    "The quality of assets is significant factor to assess the financial strength of a bank. Risks to the solvency often arise from an impairment of assets, and for banks in particular the profitability is expressed through the quality of loan book. The deterioration in the financial health of the borrowers can misbalance the asset composition and therefore **the ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total loans** is often used as a proxy for measuring the asset quality. Assesment of non-performing loans - loans and leases 90+ days past due, nonaccrual and noncurrent loans, also give us insights into the composition and diversification of loan portfolio, where mainly the ratio between secured and total advances plays an important role, the greater the security against loans the lesser is the risk.\n",
